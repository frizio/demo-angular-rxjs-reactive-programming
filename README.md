# Demo Angular Rxjs Reactive Programming

RxJs is a toolkit that allow us to build asyncronous applications in reactive style using the Observable pattern.

### Part 1
- Reactive Programming
- Observable Pattern
- RxJs library and its operators
- Observables and Subjects

### Part 2
#### browser event experiment
#### event bus experiment
- Global Event Bus
- Observable Pattern
- Solving the problem of component communication (not nested) by using a global event bus based on the observer pattern 
- Epilogo
-- Data ownering and encapsulation: no central owner of the data;
-- Event Bus (analogo a SUBJECT) globally accessible: everyone can registry and notify events;
-- Timing: sequentiality in event registration and notification.
